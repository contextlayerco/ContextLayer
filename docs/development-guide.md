# Development Guide

Welcome to the **Context Layer** Development Guide! This document provides detailed instructions for developers on how to extend and build on top of the **Context Layer** platform. Whether you're creating custom AI agents, developing new smart contract integrations, or contributing to the core platform, this guide will help you get started.

## 1. Setting Up the Development Environment

Before you begin development, make sure your environment is properly configured.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager)
* **Truffle Suite** for smart contract development
* **Ganache** (for local Ethereum testing)

### Install Dependencies

Start by cloning the repository and installing the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contextlayerco/contextlayer.git
cd contextlayer
npm install
```

### Setup Local Ethereum Network (Optional)

If you're planning to interact with Ethereum smart contracts locally, you can use **Ganache** to run a local Ethereum network. Download Ganache and start a local blockchain instance.

* Download: [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
* Configure your `.env` file to use the local Ethereum network:

```bash
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=http://localhost:7545
```

## 2. Creating a Custom AI Agent

AI agents are the core entities in **Context Layer**. You can create a custom AI agent by following the steps below.

### Step 1: Define Your Agent's Logic

Start by defining the logic for your AI agent. This can include decision-making algorithms, interactions with decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain transactions.

Example:

```javascript
class CustomAI {
    constructor(web3, contractAddress) {
        this.web3 = web3;
        this.contractAddress = contractAddress;
        this.contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);
    }

    async analyzeBlockchainData(data) {
        if (data.price > 100) {
            this.executeTrade();
        }
    }

    async executeTrade() {
        await this.contract.methods.tradeTokens().send({ from: this.walletAddress });
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Integrate the AI Agent with the Context Layer Protocol

After defining the agent’s logic, integrate it with the **Context Layer Protocol** to ensure it interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol will provide the necessary interfaces for real-time data processing.

```javascript
const agent = new CustomAI(web3, contractAddress);
ContextLayerProtocol.registerAgent(agent);
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Agent

Once your AI agent is ready, you can deploy it using the provided deployment scripts:

```bash
npm run deploy-agent
```

The agent will be deployed to the blockchain, ready to start interacting with decentralized services.

## 3. Interacting with Ethereum Smart Contracts

**Context Layer** enables AI agents to interact with Ethereum smart contracts. Here’s how you can set up smart contract interactions in your agent.

### Example: Sending Transactions to a Smart Contract

```javascript
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

async function interactWithContract() {
    const tx = await contract.methods.someMethod().send({ from: walletAddress });
    console.log("Transaction Sent:", tx);
}
```

This interaction sends a transaction to a smart contract on the Ethereum network. Ensure you’ve configured the **walletAddress** and the correct smart contract ABI.

## 4. Building New Integrations

**Context Layer** allows you to integrate additional services and protocols. Whether it’s integrating with new dApps, external APIs, or Layer 2 solutions, you can easily extend the platform.

### Example: Integrating a New dApp

To integrate a new decentralized application (dApp) with **Context Layer**, you'll need to:

1. Define the dApp’s interaction interface (e.g., contract ABI).
2. Implement the necessary functions to communicate with the dApp’s smart contracts.
3. Use the **Context Layer Protocol** to allow AI agents to interact with the dApp.

Example of integrating a decentralized exchange (DEX):

```javascript
class DEXIntegration {
    constructor(web3, dexContractAddress) {
        this.dexContract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, dexContractAddress);
    }

    async swapTokens(tokenA, tokenB, amount) {
        const tx = await this.dexContract.methods.swap(tokenA, tokenB, amount).send({ from: walletAddress });
        console.log("Tokens Swapped:", tx);
    }
}
```

## 5. Testing Your Code

To ensure your code works as expected, **Context Layer** supports unit testing and integration testing.

### Setting Up Tests

1. Install the necessary testing dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev mocha chai
   ```

2. Create test files in the `test/` directory and write your tests:

```javascript
const { assert } = require('chai');
const CustomAI = require('../src/CustomAI');

describe('CustomAI Tests', () => {
    it('should execute trade when price exceeds threshold', () => {
        const ai = new CustomAI(mockWeb3, mockContract);
        ai.analyzeBlockchainData({ price: 150 });
        assert.isTrue(ai.tradeExecuted);
    });
});
```

3. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
