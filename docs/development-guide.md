# Development Guide

Welcome to the **Context Layer** Development Guide. This guide provides you with the necessary steps and resources to build, test, and deploy components on the **Context Layer** platform.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To begin developing with **Context Layer**, you need to set up the following tools:

1. **Node.js & npm**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) to manage dependencies and run the development environment.
2. **Truffle**: A popular development framework for Ethereum, used to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts.

   * Install via npm:
     `npm install -g truffle`
3. **Ganache**: A personal Ethereum blockchain for testing and deploying contracts.

   * Download [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

### Example Setup

1. Clone the **Context Layer** repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/contextlayerco/contextlayer.git
   cd contextlayer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start Ganache to create a local test network.

4. Compile and migrate the contracts using Truffle:

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate
   ```

### Running Tests

We encourage testing as you develop to ensure everything works as expected.

1. Run unit tests with Truffle:

   ```bash
   truffle test
   ```

2. You can also write and execute smart contract tests using **Mocha** and **Chai** (commonly used with Truffle).

## Writing Smart Contracts

When developing for **Context Layer**, the core components are smart contracts interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. Here are some important considerations:

### Contract Design

1. **Modularity**: Break down your contract into smaller, manageable modules for better maintainability.
2. **Security**: Always check for common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, overflow, and underflow attacks. Use OpenZeppelin contracts for secure, audited implementations.

### Example Contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ContextLayer {

    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }

    function updateOwner(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

## Integrating AI Agents

The **Context Layer** allows you to develop AI agents that can interact with Ethereum smart contracts and react to events.

1. **ContextLayer Protocol**: This protocol enables the communication between AI agents and the Ethereum blockchain. It provides real-time data to your AI agents.
2. **AI Agent Development**: Develop AI agents using Python or any AI framework. Use the ContextLayer Protocol to send and receive blockchain data.

### Example AI Agent

```python
from contextlayer.protocol import ContextLayerProtocol

class MyAgent:
    def __init__(self, blockchain_data):
        self.blockchain_data = blockchain_data

    def make_decision(self):
        if self.blockchain_data['price'] > 100:
            return 'BUY'
        else:
            return 'SELL'

# Initialize and make decision based on blockchain data
agent = MyAgent(blockchain_data)
decision = agent.make_decision()
```

## Deploying Your Application

Once your contracts are deployed and the AI agent is ready, it’s time to integrate everything and deploy.

1. **Deploy the Smart Contracts**: Use Truffle’s migration feature to deploy the contracts to the Ethereum network.
2. **Run the AI Agent**: Deploy the AI agent and connect it to the blockchain. Ensure that it’s receiving live data and making decisions based on it.

## Contributing to Context Layer

We welcome contributions to Context Layer! Whether it’s fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your contributions are valuable and help make the platform stronger.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**: Begin by forking the [Context Layer repository](#) to your GitHub account.

2. **Create a new branch**: Once you've forked the repository, create a new branch from the `main` branch for your changes.

3. **Make your changes**: Modify the code, fix bugs, or add new features. Be sure to write tests for new features to maintain code integrity.

4. **Write tests**: For any new features, make sure to add corresponding tests to ensure the platform behaves as expected.

5. **Submit a pull request (PR)**: Once you’ve made your changes, submit a pull request with a clear description of what you’ve changed and why. Ensure the PR is against the `main` branch.

6. **Review process**: After submitting your PR, it will be reviewed by a team member. If there are any changes required, they will be discussed and incorporated.
