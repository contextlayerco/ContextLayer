# 🗺️ ContextLayer Roadmap

ContextLayer merges AI and blockchain into one unified execution layer — built for onchain agents that don’t just talk, but act. Below is our milestone-based roadmap combined with the core modules that power each phase.

---

## 📦 Q2 2025 – Foundation Layer

Core focus: Agent deployment, secure execution, and base infrastructure.

- [x] Autonomous Agent Deployment (Chat & Voice)
- [ ] ERC-20 Token Swaps (via smart contracts)
- [x] Encrypted Onchain Transfers
- [ ] Wallet Integration (Privy-based)
- [x] Decentralized IPFS Frontend
- [x] Context Memory (save commands, track history)

## 🚀 Q3 2025 – Utility Expansion

Core focus: Multi-chain support, dev tools, and agent intelligence.

- [ ] Multi-chain Support (Bridge, Swap across chains)
- [ ] Contact Book: Name-tagged wallet contacts
- [ ] Agent Memory Upgrades: Long-term intent recall
- [ ] Voice Command Customization (multi-language, accent handling)
- [ ] Advanced Swap Routing (DEX aggregator integration)
- [ ] Privacy Layer Research (zk + MPC trials)
- [ ] ContextAI Lab – Build, test, and optimize AI agents
- [ ] LayerStore (Beta) – Marketplace for agents & modules
- [ ] Context Developer Suite – SDKs, templates, and boilerplates

## 🌐 Q4 2025 – Ecosystem Growth

Core focus: Infrastructure hardening, SDKs, transparency, and scale.

- [ ] Context API – RESTful interface for agent commands
- [ ] ChainSecurity – Data encryption & smart contract protection
- [ ] ContextChain – Onchain interaction & logging
- [ ] AI Agent SDK for Developers
- [ ] Agent Store: Deploy and monetize community-built agents
- [ ] LayerMesh – Decentralized compute for scalable AI agents
