# Introduction

Welcome to **Context Layer** – the decentralized platform designed to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology to build intelligent, autonomous, and context-aware decentralized applications (dApps). **Context Layer** empowers developers by providing a set of tools and protocols for creating, deploying, and managing AI agents that can interact seamlessly with the Ethereum blockchain (ERC20).

This documentation will guide you through the architecture, features, setup, and integration of the **Context Layer** platform. Whether you are a developer building the next generation of decentralized applications, or a business looking to leverage blockchain and AI technologies, **Context Layer** offers the resources you need to succeed.

## What is Context Layer?

**Context Layer** is a decentralized AI-powered ecosystem designed to enable intelligent agents to interact with blockchain data in real time. By providing a platform for context-aware decision-making, **Context Layer** allows developers to create autonomous agents that can process, analyze, and act on blockchain data as it changes over time.

Our platform leverages Ethereum's security and transparency to create a reliable environment for deploying AI models, executing smart contracts, and managing decentralized systems.

## Key Features:
- **AI-Powered Agents**: Autonomous agents that make context-driven decisions based on real-time blockchain data.
- **Seamless Blockchain Integration**: Built on Ethereum (ERC20), enabling secure and transparent interactions with decentralized applications (dApps).
- **Developer Tools**: A comprehensive suite of tools, SDKs, and APIs to simplify the development and deployment of AI-driven decentralized applications.
- **Scalability & Security**: Decentralized infrastructure built to handle high-demand conditions, with robust security measures to protect both agents and smart contracts.

## Core Vision

The primary goal of **Context Layer** is to revolutionize the way AI and blockchain interact. We aim to bridge the gap between intelligent agents and the blockchain, enabling the next generation of decentralized autonomous systems. With **Context Layer**, developers can create systems that:
- Make real-time decisions based on dynamic blockchain data.
- Automate processes in decentralized environments.
- Interact securely with smart contracts and on-chain data.

By integrating AI with blockchain technology, **Context Layer** is paving the way for autonomous systems that can improve efficiency, transparency, and security in a variety of industries, including Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Governance, and more.

## Who Should Use Context Layer?

**Context Layer** is designed for developers, blockchain enthusiasts, AI researchers, and businesses looking to integrate intelligent decision-making into their decentralized applications.
