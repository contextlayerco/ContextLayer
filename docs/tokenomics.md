## üß† $CXLYR Utility Plan

At this stage, **$CXLYR does not yet have direct utility** ‚Äî and this is by design.

We‚Äôre still early, with a small market cap and a focus on building. Launching token utility too early can create unhealthy pressure and speculation before real users are in place.

Our top priority right now is to **build the product** and get people actively using the **ContextLayer AI agent**.

### Future Utility of $CXLYR

As the platform and user base grow, $CXLYR will power the entire ContextLayer ecosystem:

- ü™ô **Pay for onchain agent actions**  
  Use $CXLYR to perform actions like swaps, bridges, lending, and more via AI agents.

- üåê **Unlock premium features through staking**  
  Access advanced agent capabilities and voice-based automation with staked tokens.

- ü§ñ **Customize AI agents**  
  Personalize your onchain agent‚Äôs behavior and skills using $CXLYR.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Reward developers and contributors**  
  Incentivize builders creating tools, modules, and plugins for the ContextLayer protocol.

- üó≥Ô∏è **Participate in governance**  
  Vote on upgrades, protocol parameters, and ecosystem decisions.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Token utility will launch gradually as the protocol matures. Real utility follows real adoption.
