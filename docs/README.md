# Context Layer Documentation

Welcome to the **Context Layer** project documentation. This guide will help you understand the features, setup, and integration of the Context Layer platform. 

Context Layer is a decentralized platform that empowers AI agents to interact with Ethereum's blockchain, enabling context-aware decision-making. It provides a foundation for intelligent decentralized applications (dApps), where AI agents autonomously interact with blockchain data to make decisions and execute tasks.
