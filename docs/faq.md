# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is Context Layer?

**Context Layer** is a decentralized platform that enables AI agents to make context-aware decisions based on real-time blockchain data. It integrates AI with the Ethereum blockchain to provide intelligent, scalable, and secure systems for various use cases in decentralized finance, governance, and more.

## How does Context Layer work?

Context Layer uses a protocol that enables AI agents to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain. The AI agents can process real-time blockchain data, make decisions, and trigger smart contracts or decentralized applications (DApps) based on that data. It operates on a decentralized infrastructure provided by **LayerMesh** and ensures security with **ChainSecurity**.

## What are the key components of Context Layer?

- **AI Agents**: Autonomous agents that interact with the blockchain and make context-driven decisions.
- **Context Layer Protocol**: The protocol that facilitates real-time blockchain data processing for AI agents.
- **Ethereum Blockchain (ERC20)**: The decentralized infrastructure that powers the platform.
- **ContextChain**: The integration layer for seamless communication between AI agents and the Ethereum blockchain.
- **LayerMesh**: The decentralized infrastructure layer that supports scalable and efficient deployment of AI models.
- **ChainSecurity**: The security framework ensuring data integrity and secure interactions within the platform.
