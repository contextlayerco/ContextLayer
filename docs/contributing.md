# Contributing to Context Layer

We welcome contributions to the **Context Layer** project! Whether you’re fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or helping with translations, your contributions are valuable and appreciated.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the repository. This creates a copy of the project where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase.

- Click the **Fork** button on the top right of the repository page.

### 2. Create a New Branch
After forking the repository, create a new branch to work on your changes. The branch name should reflect the nature of your changes. 

- Example: `feature-add-new-feature`, `bugfix-fix-typo`, etc.

### 3. Make Your Changes
Now, make the necessary changes to the project. We encourage you to write tests for any new features, refactor the code, or add comments where necessary to help others understand your changes.

### 4. Commit Your Changes
Once you’re happy with the changes, commit them with a clear and concise message. Follow the **conventional commit** style for commit messages to maintain consistency across the repository.

Example:
```

feat: add new feature for real-time blockchain integration
fix: typo in README.md

````

### 5. Push Changes
Push your changes to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
````

### 6. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository. Provide a clear and detailed description of the changes you’ve made and why they should be merged.

* Go to the repository’s **Pull Requests** tab.
* Click **New Pull Request**.
* Select your branch and compare it with the main branch.
* Fill out the PR template (if provided) and submit the PR.

### 7. Review and Feedback

Once your PR is submitted, the maintainers will review your changes. You might be asked to make further modifications or improvements. Please be responsive to feedback and make necessary updates.

### 8. Merge the PR

Once the PR is approved, it will be merged into the main codebase. You will be notified once this is done!
